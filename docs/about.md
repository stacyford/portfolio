Hello!

I'm Stacy, and I've officially been a technical writer since 2014, although my interest in writing far precedes that. 

I've been working in tech for the vast majority of my career. 

My first job in technology was, unsurprisingly, as a helpdesk analyst. Working in support is a great way to learn about your product and processes as a whole, and as a writer, I find that it also helps me to understand where my readers are coming from. I know what sort of questions they might ask and what sort of mistakes they might make. I also spent time as a PC tech and as a security and compliance admin, which was pretty useful when making he transition into technical writing. 

I really enjoy working in the software industry. I like the people and the constant new technologies and opportunities to learn. I am not bored when writing about software. There's just always something new to learn or figure out. 

Outside of work, I've lived in Texas my whole life, with a couple of brief adventures away to Tennessee and Washington, DC, for college. I like to read, bake, play around online, play with my cats, and spend time with my family.
