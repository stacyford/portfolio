The following are some examples of documentation that I have written. 

The documentation team at my current job works collaboratively.Each writer is responsible for documenting the work of their assigned development team. 

Documentation goes through a two-stage review process. First, the document is reviewed for technical accuracy by either the development team or support, depending on the origin of the request. Then, the document is taken through a peer review, where each document is reviewed for clarity and adherence to the style guide.

* [The ea-nginx script](nginx-script.md) — This document details how to use a complex script that manages NGINX on a server that runs cPanel. 
* [Package Manager Basics](package-manager-basics.md) — This document provides an introduction to the yum and apt package managers.
