title: The ea-nginx script
---

## Overview

The `/usr/local/cpanel/scripts/ea-nginx` script manages your NGINX configuration. This script will configure or remove an NGINX user, reload the user configuration, and manage the cache. To learn more about NGINX with cPanel & WHM, read our NGINX Manager and NGINX with Reverse Proxy documentation.

This script creates the userâ€™s configuration file in the following location:
{% note %}
This is a note
{% endnote %}
>/etc/nginx/conf.d/users/username.conf
